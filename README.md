# Picmash App

This project was a rapid development challenge I undertook during my college days. Given a week, and with my budding knowledge of React at the time, I crafted this frontend for the Picmash application. While I've made sure it's operational for portfolio purposes, I haven't made significant changes to it since its initial creation.

The application is built using React, JavaScript, and CSS.

## Live Demo

You can view the live demo of the app [here](https://picmash-app.netlify.app/).

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/Vinayak1337/picmash-app.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
```
cd picmash-app
```

3. Before starting the frontend, ensure that the [backend server](https://github.com/Vinayak1337/picmash-server) is up and running.

4. Create a `.env` file in the root directory. Inside this file, set the `BASE_URL` to point to your backend server.
```
BASE_URL=http://your_backend_server_url_here
```

5. Install the required dependencies and start the application:
```
npm install
npm start
```

The application should now be running on `localhost:3000` or the next available port.
